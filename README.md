    <h1> Interview Prep AI-ML-DS 🤖</h1>
</div>

Welcome to the **AI-ML-DS Interview Prep** repository — a curated and structured resource designed to help you prepare for technical interviews in **Artificial Intelligence**, **Machine Learning**, and **Data Science** roles.

## ✅ What is it?

This is a **modular, topic-based guide** to build, refresh, and test your knowledge across core areas typically covered in interviews:

- 🧠 AI: Search, logic, planning, knowledge representation  
- 🤖 ML: Supervised/unsupervised learning, metrics, pipelines  
- 📊 Data Science: Statistics, EDA, visualization, business use-cases  
- 💻 Coding exercises: Python, Leetcode-style problems, notebooks  
- 🧩 System design & deployment basics  
- 💬 Behavioral & soft skill preparation  

Everything is organized to support **self-paced learning**, interview **revision**, and **quick lookup** before interviews.

## ❓ Why use it?

Whether you're:
- A **beginner** entering the AI/ML/DS space,
- A **job-seeker** preparing for upcoming interviews,
- Or a **practitioner** brushing up on fundamentals,

this repo brings together theory, practice, and real-world questions into one structured space — avoiding the chaos of scattered bookmarks and half-finished courses.
